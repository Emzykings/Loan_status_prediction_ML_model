Banks earn a major revenue from lending loans. But it is often associated with risk. The borrower's may default on the loan. To mitigate this issue, the banks have decided to use Machine Learning to overcome this issue.

The dataset is enormous &amp; consists of multiple deteministic factors like borrowe's income, gender, loan pupose etc. The dataset is subject to strong multicollinearity &amp; empty values. This model is created to overcome these factors &amp; build a strong classifier to predict defaulter
